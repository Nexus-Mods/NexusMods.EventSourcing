# NexusMods.EventSourcing

EventSourcing and CQRS library for .NET. This library is designed for single process multi threaded applications, and
provides
extremely high performance event sourcing and CQRS capabilities. The current datastore is based on RocksDB, but the
interface is
designed to be easily swapped out for other storage systems.
